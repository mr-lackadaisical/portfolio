  <h3 class="text-warning text-center my-4">SELFIE E</h3>
  <p class="h4 text-light text-center m-4">This piece shows the anxiety that teenagers feel regarding their self image. With the emergence of social media, a person can connect with hundreds of people. When we post and share with people on social media we often find ourselves worrying about what others think of us, how we look or whether other people find us attractive or not. We often start focusing on our flaws and feel uncomfortable in our own body. This lowers our self esteem and degrades our self image. To create this artwork, I asked my family and friends to make a drawing of my face and made a portrait using the drawing they gave. I created a drawing that I didnâ€™t draw. I also made a drawing that illustrates how I think other people view me. Ironically I ended up spending my time and energy to know what others think of me to create a drawing that shows how we spend our time and energy worrying about what others think of us.
