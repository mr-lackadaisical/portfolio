  <h3 class="text-warning text-center my-4">THE COIN</h3>
  <p class="h4 text-light text-center m-4">My grandpa had bipolar disorder. My dad told me that like a coin grandpa had two sides , whichever side I saw it was the same coin, the same person, my grandpa . He passed away when i was 8 years old. During the lockdown dad was telling us about his childhood and grandpa and I wanted to make his portrait. I wanted to show both sides of my grandpa in such a way that each side can be distinctly visible, so if you place a mirror in the centre you can see both sides, the heads and tails.
  </p>
  <h4 class="text-warning my-4"> Heads</h4>
  <p class="h4 text-light text-center m-4">In this stage he used to be full of energy and could hardly sleep. He used to talk a lot and used to tinker with things. He used to be annoyed all the time and got very angry and upset very frequently.
</p>
<h4 class="text-warning my-4"> Tails</h4>
<p class="h4 text-light text-center m-4">He used to look tired and out of energy in this stage. He wasnâ€™t interested in anything and nothing excited him . He was sad all the time and slept for long hours.
